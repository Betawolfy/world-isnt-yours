Connecting using the Bedrock edition depends on the platform you are using, so I apologize, but I'll once again ask you to choose which platform you are using, and follow the instructions.

<Aside type="note" title="note regarding xbox live.">
    For All the versions of Bedrock, you are ***required*** to have a XBOX LIVE account. Without it, you won't be able to play online. 
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Console workaround works also for PC and mobile!">
    The workaround for console players also applies to PC and mobile players. So if you're on mobile or PC (Bedrock Edition), you can use the same method to join the server.
</Aside>
