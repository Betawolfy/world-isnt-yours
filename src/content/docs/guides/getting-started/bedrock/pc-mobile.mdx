## 1. Launch your game.
Imagine wanting to play without launching the game, that would be pretty crazy, right?

This should bring you here!

You can enter any **server name** you want, as it is mainly used for you to stay organized.
You need to enter the following string into **Server Address**: 

```txt
smp.distinct-errors.fr
```

And you must ***KEEP*** the port as:

```txt
19132
```

## 4. Click "Add server" and voilà! 🎊

## 5. Don't forget to register!

Once you join the server for the first time, you will be asked to do the command `/register <password>`.

Since the server is allowed to cracked version, anyone can choose the nickname they want. We have decided to add a password system to counter unwanted login from strangers.

Once you log in, decide a strong password between 6–18 characters.
