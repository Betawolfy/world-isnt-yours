Every players has to choose an mutation. 
In Distinct Errors SMP, we are using the plugin version of Origins, which leads to the GUI not being the best for you to choose. 
So to avoid you wasting time, we will explain you here all origins present in the mod (without passing through Fandom and their 2093 ADs)

Here is a list of all the Mutations you can choose from, with a little description of their powers and weaknesses.
