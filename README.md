# Distinct Errors Wiki - Version 2

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

`World isn't yours` is the project name of the version 2 of the wiki destined to be used by Distinct Errors SMP players.

This wiki contains various informations about [Origins](https://wiki-v2.distinct-errors.fr/guides/origins/) or [guides to join us](https://wiki-v2.distinct-errors.fr/guides/getting-started/) and much more in the future.

We are currently using ***Starlight*** to make this wiki / documentation place possible.

## Usage

Using Starlist is easy!
Default config looks like this:

```txt
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

***Everything you shall update is on `src/content/docs/`!!***
